# 2-1 Multiplexer using Pseudo-NMOS Logic and CMOS Logic

This project demonstrates the design and simulation of a 2-to-1 multiplexer (MUX) using both Pseudo-NMOS logic and CMOS logic. The design and simulations were carried out using the Cadence Virtuoso environment.

## Introduction
A multiplexer is a combinational circuit that selects one of the many input signals and directs it to the output. The 2-to-1 MUX selects one of the two inputs based on a single control signal. This project explores two implementations of the 2-to-1 MUX: one using pseudo-NMOS logic and the other using CMOS logic.

## Design Overview
### Pseudo-NMOS Logic
Pseudo-NMOS logic uses a combination of NMOS transistors and a weak PMOS transistor that is always on. This approach is known for its simplicity and speed but consumes static power.

### CMOS Logic
CMOS logic uses both PMOS and NMOS transistors to implement the logic gates. It is known for its low power consumption and high noise immunity.


This project was carried out using the Cadence Virtuoso software suite, and I give special thanks to the guidance and support from the faculty and peers.
